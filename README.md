# Search Buttons Bar
A XUL addon for Firefox and Pale Moon browsers.

## Features:
- A search toolbar with one-click search. Type in the search box and click a search engine button. Hitting enter key will make a search with currently selected search engine.
- The search engine buttons are clickable links to the site's home page when there are no search words typed in the search box.
- Managing the search engines can be done with the Pale Moon's search engine manager.
- The search toolbar is customizable which allows to add and remove toolbar items.
- Option to select which engines are displayed in the toolbar.

This add-on was requested by the Pale Moon community.

## TODO:
- Option to select which engines are displayed in the toolbar.
